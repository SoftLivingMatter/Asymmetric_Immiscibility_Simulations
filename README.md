This is a repository of Python scripts by Ushnish Rana associated with the manuscript "Asymmetric oligomerization state and sequence patterning can tune multiphase condensate miscibility" published on Bioxriv on March 12, 2023, and all subsequent versions of this manuscript. It contains simulation scripts for MD software HOOMD-Blue 2.9.7 to perform direct coexistence simulations for estimating the relative miscibility of model disordered proteins.

Code for setting up HPS model NVT simulations was adapted from [slab_builder](https://github.com/Roshan-M-Regy/slab_builder/tree/79283702a304556b46e53eeaede0f6a706299a86).
